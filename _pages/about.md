<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I am now an associate professor (100 Young Academic Leaders of Nankai University) in the College of Cryptology and Cyber Science, Nankai University. I am a member of [NKSSecLab](https://nksseclab.github.io/), lead by [Prof. Sen Chen](https://sen-chen.github.io/). I am also a member of the research group led by [Prof. Zheli Liu](https://cc.nankai.edu.cn/2021/0323/c13619a548877/page.htm). I was a postdoctoral scholar working with [Prof. Shuai Wang](https://home.cse.ust.hk/~shuaiw/) and [Prof. Daoyuan Wu](https://daoyuan14.github.io/), in Department of Computer Science and Engineering at the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (HKUST) from 2024 to 2026. I obtained my Ph.D. degree in Software Engineering Institute at East China Normal University (ECNU), under the supervision of [Prof. Yixiang Chen](https://faculty.ecnu.edu.cn/_s43/cyx/main.psp). I was also a visiting student at Nanyang Technological University under the supervision of [Prof. Yang Liu](https://personal.ntu.edu.sg/yangliu/) during 2022-2024. My research interests include program analysis, vulnerability detection. I hope to collaborate with more innovative researchers on various exciting topics in software engineering, program analysis, vulnerability detection, and program synthesis. 



<span style="color:red;"> NKSSecLab is recruiting motivated and talented master and Ph.D. students working on software security and blockchain security. If you are interested, please feel free to reach out to me. </span>
